These are the scripts that make up the bulk of the combat system in Clockworld. If given the time I would edit them a lot, better organizing functions and simplyfying a lot the Update function of the main class (CombatManager.cs). I would also change the system to only rely on callbacks from the FMOD engine, instead of using a mix of those callbacks and the physics engine of Unity (the project was for my last year of studies. I learned about the callbacks only when most of the system was already in place and because of the deadlines I never got the time to properly rewrite that code, and only used the FMOD callbacks as a failsafe measure).
